## Bio.

I'm a second year Interactive Arts & Science student at Brock University.
My specific research area of interest is the digital expression field associated with foundations towards media and art curation, which I wish to specialize in "the gap in between what I have learned from the digital aspect of humanities with the visual components from art electives".In my free time, I enjoy taking pictures, making music, and watching movies. 
For the future, I aspire to be a content creator in digital media.
