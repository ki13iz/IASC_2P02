## Bio.

I'm currnetly a second year student at Brock University majoring in Interactive Arts & Science.
My specific research area of interest is the digital expression field associated with foundations towards media and art curation, which I wish to specialize in "the gap in between what I have learned from the digital aspect of humanities with the visual components from art electives". In the blend of this concentration, I'd say media transformations alongside the issues that revolve in the digital humanities are two of the very few areas that really captivate me and allow honest and flexible contribution. In my free time outside lectures, I enjoy taking pictures, editing videos, producing music, and watching movies. These culterd elements of design and media really help develop a better sense of where I aim on taking things in the future. Every now and then, I grasp whatever material that was taught from the courses I'm enrolled in and apply them to ideas and concepts that already intrigue me. Essentially, Multimedia Design is where I see potential as a career choice given what I already know about digital curation of content and how technology aligns with the way we interact with it. The work displayed below are prominent examples of the highlight in which my specialization is involved.

## Featured Project: BETAMAX

![](Images/BETA2.png)

BETAMAX was the very first video-casette recording technology (VCR) that was produced by Sony in 1975. 
With the capability of being able to control the flow of TV time, this pioneer device allowed for users to record up to an hour of audio-video footage from their own homes. This was a significant feature that wasn't seen till the modern DVRs of the early 2000s. Now, shortly after Sony's successful release had come a brand new technological advancement from the company JVC, which was the VHS (Video Home System). As opposed to the VCR, VHS offered a much wider capacity for recording and playback capabilities and required less wear to fully function/maintain use. From this point on, the home video recording and reproduction market was more or less in their grip.
The late 80s saw competitve means between the two platofroms and resulted in a format wars. In the midst of legality allegations, VCR consumption saw a downfall but formed a new sense of relevance in the market with its 'home-video recording technology' which made a case in court. The case adresses the allegations which Universal Studios declared towards Sony Corporation of America involving copyright infringement by allowing users to record TV content from their own homes. The following action was concluded as fair use because it doesn't constitue in any forms against law, the only it would do so is if people made copies of the content they were recording (pirating), a very common scheme used today which is considered illegal. I do strongly believe that the early influence of such act does stem to this technology that VCR had introduced, but its very low-profile. Its evident how much of an impact its operative use and interactiona technolgy has had on a lot of the more recent devices that we use today such as: Blu-Ray DVR players, Sony-Slim HD systems, Panaasonic, Toshiba and even built-in Windows Media Players. 

Based on constructive criticism to my presentation, I took the time the develop a much stronger archaeological standpoint for the technology, as it wasn't as clear or present in earlier discussion. Arguing the 'cultural and technological relationship' that can be seen when aiming to assign a type of value towards an artefactual form is the whole point that I wanted to apply with Betamax and its revolutionary shift in time. In this segment of discussion, I did a lot of backward thinking to get my general points and relative ideas across by perpetuating its means and looking beyond its discontinuance. My research ranged from comparisons to vinyl and analog forms of music to the alternative forms of Betamax (video camera), followed by the battle between newer renditions (Blu-ray vs. HD DVDs). My changes mainly included more photos in correspondence to text and more validity in reasons behind the points, broadening the whole dynamic of discussion. My first change can be seen [here](https://github.com/ki13iz/IASC_2P02/commit/73f6f542458313dd5497a7a748d5552125e98deb#diff-cb92ad7351df6b9274b9ab5b97227cf3R118)
where I address digital mediums on a general spectrum in accordance to most common forms of practice, the origins that have been advanced, and the grey underlining between concentrations and time. My second major change is moving on the next point where I look into what Sony had introduced after VCR obsoleteness, Betacams and their influence on the now of video camera recording technology, seen [here](https://github.com/ki13iz/IASC_2P02/commit/73f6f542458313dd5497a7a748d5552125e98deb#diff-cb92ad7351df6b9274b9ab5b97227cf3R127). My last prominent change in discussion was the presence of home-video technology that was introduced by Betamax, which is now involved in the battle of more current formats such as Blu-ray and HD DVDs, referenced [here](https://github.com/ki13iz/IASC_2P02/commit/73f6f542458313dd5497a7a748d5552125e98deb#diff-cb92ad7351df6b9274b9ab5b97227cf3R136). Overall these changes show how much more valid my topic of discussion stands in archaelogical perspective.

## Colaborative Project: Serendip-o-matic/Google Arts & Culture

For the collaborative portion of this course, my group members and I focused on two digital humanities tools: Serendip-o-matic and Google Arts & Culture. Serendip-o-matic is a platform that connects one’s sources to digital archives, libraries, materials, and museums around the world we live in. This source helps organize and discover newer sources that at times appear out of reach. Google Arts & Culture is platform designed as a digital museum where one can find, research, and educate themselves with everything regarding the literature, historical facts, locations, and means behind all arts and culture to ever exist. 

With this project, collaborative scholarship was achieved by being able to share different contributions and viewpoints to general topic discussion using Google Docs. This made each of our individual parts much more easy and accountable with given timeframe for project completion. In addition to project contribution, a lot of scheduled work time in the Brock library was also attained as we were able to help each other progress towards a means of comprehension and targeted goals. Collaborative research for the digital humanities is a key attribute to my learning as I’m able to attain more general knowledge and make better use of my time. In my portion of this collaborative project, I focused on ways in which Google Arts & Culture as a digital medium can be explored given its highlighted feature content: Art Camera, 360 videos, along with street view. Located [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/commit/ea60634f2676934e3736e6445c254623c298f507) are notes that I have made to keep on track with my target discussion and points of reference.
