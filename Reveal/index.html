                               When looking at Betamax technology and how it applies to media archaeology, it’s perceived position of ‘dead media’ is very much still alive and prevails in a lot of the technology we use today. 
                               The reality of it all is really what we fail to recognize, the form still defines our relationship with cultural and technological media.
                               By trying to remove old and pioneer technology from the scene, its original aesthetic and significance becomes more relevant when assigning cultural value to the rendition or advancement of the artefact itself.
                               Ignoring past media completely only makes our present less comprehendible.

                                In most cases, when I discover a new form of media and/or technology that intrigues me, I enjoy leaning a bit about its history and how it came along. 
                                This is how I’m able to make sense of it even if the concept is clear and straight forward. 
                                The physical discontinuance of Sony’s Betamax is a prominent one, however, the use of similar analog technology is not overshadowed and is still commonly preferred over many digital mediums and interfaces. 
                                Take the use of vinyl in hipster culture for example, the physical copies of soundtracks in some cases provide more user enjoyability as opposed to simply streaming or purchasing digital versions.

                                Now, aside from the actual Betamax system, Sony still had the will to produce further installments of the original system, ignoring its fallen position in the market industry. 
                                These newer editions included: Betacam, Betacam SP, followed by digital Betacam. 
                                Betacam as a whole was a high capacity videotape recorder which used magnetic tape technology, similar to the Betamax platform.
                                Developed by Sony in 1982, the device offered simple video playback capabilities that is still very populous in modern day when aiming to achieve this likeable vintage frame of perception.

                                In archaeological terms, the most recent form of Betamax technology is present with Blu-ray and HD DVDs which are in high competitions amongst themselves.
                                The addition of Blu-ray incorporated onto PS3 devices was a highlight for Sony in both cases as they own both digital platforms, however, such implications came with a great expense. 
                                Home video market based on the ‘living room’ of viewers had quickly become a standard for high-definition disk delivery because of cinema companies co-paring with Blu-ray/Ultra HD.
                                Essentially in our day and age, most individuals rely on wi-fi to access digital streaming services such as Netlfix and Amazon TV.

                                In the treasured piece of technology and media that Sony’s Betamax falls under, it is clear as to how evident its impact lies throughout the evolution of film and video playback.
                                The magnetic memory which prevails and compliments its original notion being “the perception of time” is a more reliable and transparent concept than we already perceive it to be.
                                As mentioned earlier, the typical reality that is often misrecognized is the archaeological relationship found between shifting cultures and technologies within recurring mediums.
